# Function

### Do you write a long line of codes then when you want to reuse it again you rewrite them again? It is a tired and not smart way to write your codes? So, what you can do? 

### The simple answer that we found is to use the **function!** What is the function? 
### **Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

### So, the function help you to group a series of statements together that are required to answer a question or perform a task that helps you. See the following code for an example of a function:

    ```
    function myFunction(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    var x = myFunction(4, 3);
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    ```

### Let us explain some parts of this function:
-  ### We have a " Calling the function":
    ### That what you should do to call your function, write its name.
     ```
    myFunction(4, 3);
    ```
- ### We have a "Parameters":
    ### Pieces of information passed to a function.
    ```
    function myFunction(a, b) {
    // (a and b) here called the Parameters
    ```
- ### We have a "Return value":
    ### The answer or the response of your function.
    ```
    function myFunction(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    var x = myFunction(4, 3);
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    // the return value is 12 (4*3)
    ``` 

### Go and try these functions in your codes, then see how it will be after you used them.
