<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">**Responsive Web Design** </span>
<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)"><br>
 Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites. <br><br>

- <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Flexible Layouts</span><br>

    <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.</span>

    <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. For even more control within a flexible layout, you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.The flexible layout approach alone isn’t enough. At times the width of a browser viewport may be so small that even scaling the the layout proportionally will create columns that are too small to effectively display content. Specifically, when the layout gets too small, or too large, text may become illegible and the layout may begin to break. In this event, media queries can be used to help build a better experience.</span>

<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">**Floats** </span>
<span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)"><br>
What is “Float”? <br>
Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”. Here is an example of that.<br><br>
</span> 

- <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">What are floats used for?</span><br>

    <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">While floats can still be used for layout, these days, we have much stronger tools for creating layout on web pages. Namely, Flexbox and Grid. Floats are still useful to know about because they have some abilities entirely unique to them, which is all covered in this article.</span> 



- <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Clearing the Float</span><br>

    <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. </span> 


- <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Problems with Floats</span><br>

    <span style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px;color:rgb(60, 179, 113)">Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.</span>
