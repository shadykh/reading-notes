# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Why is access control important?
  - Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

- Describe an application that would need access control.
  - Authentication is a technique used to verify that someone is who they claim to be. Authentication isn’t sufficient by itself to protect data. What’s needed is an additional layer, authorization, which determines whether a user should be allowed to access the data or make the transaction they’re attempting.

- What is a role used for?
  - Job function or title which defines an authority level.

- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
  - Assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role. For example, an accountant in a company will be assigned to the Accountant role, gaining access to all the resources permitted for all accountants on the system. Similarly, a software engineer might be assigned to the developer role.
  - Roles differ from groups in that while users may belong to multiple groups, a user under RBAC may only be assigned a single role in an organization. Additionally, there is no way to provide individual users additional permissions over and above those available for their role. The accountant described above gets the same permissions as all other accountants, nothing more and nothing less.

## Vocabulary

- Authorization
  - It is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.

- Role Based Access Control
  -  Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

- Capabilities  
  - the authorities are bound to objects seeking access. So if the objects are laid out in a table, with the access-seeking objects across the top and the security-seeking objects down the side, the columns represent sets of capabilities

## Preparation

- Event Driven Programming
  - Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.
  - EventEmitter
    - Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.
  - Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming
    - These two make for a very valuable combination in a wide variety of situations and I think it can be beneficial to understand and conceptualize why.
    - The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.
