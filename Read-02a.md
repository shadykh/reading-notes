# What is the Git, GitHub and Markdown?

## Git and GitHup

**Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage **Git** repositories. If you have open-source projects that use **Git**, then **GitHub** is designed to help you better manage them.
In simple way we can say that **Git** as your usb-flash, you stores your files and thier versions and **GitHub** is as google cloud.
If you are fresh of all of this (and you are :p), to start with **GitHub** you should follow these steps:
* Create an account on the website.
- Sign in into your account.
+ Go to Create a repository.
- Clone the repository to your local machine. 
``` 
git Clone 'yourlink' 
``` 
* Do your editing.
* Write those following code:
``` 
    - git add "your file name"
    - git commit -m "Your comment"
    - git push origin main
``` 
* Now you are hacker (I'm kidding :p)

## Markdown files

**Markdown** file is look like your normal text files but this one has  a way to style text on the web. I will give you some examples for this. So, please check the below examples.

The Style | The Way to do it | Example
------------ | ------------- | -----------
Bold | Use `**` or `__` before and after the word| **Bold** 
Italic | Use `*` or `_` before and after the word| *Italic*
Strikethrough | Use `~~` before and after the word| ~~Strikethrough~~
Bold and nested italic | Use `**` and `_` before and after the word| **Bold and _Italic_**
All bold and italic | Use `***`  before and after the word | ***All bold and italic***


Other examples are:
- If you want to add a qouto text, you use >:
    - > This is qouto text
- If you want to add a code style, you use ``` before and after, or press tap before and after your code:
    -   ``` 
        git push origin main 
        ```
