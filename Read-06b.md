# CSS

### Until now I think you know more about Html and js, and may you have built some basic pages without styling them. So, how you can style your basic page for now.

### You will use the CSS, it  allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. 

### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
    ```
    p { font-family: Arial;}
    // p is the selector
    // { font-family: Arial;} is the declaration
    ```

### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

    ```
    h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: yellow;}
    // font-family and color are the properties
    // Arial and yellow are the values
    ```
