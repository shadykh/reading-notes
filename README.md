ASAC was inaugurated in 2019 to build the software development and programming skills and capabilities of learners while qualifying them for current and future employment within these fields.<br><br>
I am Shady Khaled and I am one of the students of ASAC, I am studying a Software Development to be a Full stack developer, in this journey I will have some tasks to do, those tasks called reading task, I should share this reading task in my reading notes (this website).<br><br>
This website built to be easy to navigate between the reading notes, it divides into four main pages, which they are Code 102, Code 201, Code 301 and Code 401, those are my courses through this journey. Every course will has its own reading notes, you can check them if you want; it will be my pleasure to see you here in my website.<br><br>
***For now only code 102 and code 201 is available***<br><br>
