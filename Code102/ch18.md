## **Process & Design:**

we will discusses the process that you will  use when you are creating a new website.
Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

We have two types of your target audience: Individuals or companies. So, you should know the answers for those questions:
> * What are their needs? 
> * Why they will visit your website? 
> * What they are searching for? 
> * How often they will visit your website?

You have the answers for those questions. How is that? When you want to build a website; you decide that because you have something to share with others! So, you know who are those people who wants what you are sharing with them. From this point you should find your ideal audience and study them to know more about them. What they are like, what they are hate and even what they are doing in the morning! Are you kidding me? No, when you know all those details, you will give them the best experience when they visit your website, **because you build this website to be suitable for them not for you!**

After you finished the above step, now you will plan for your website; How it should be? So, there is something called **site map**; which is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. And there is a technique called **card sorting**; which involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups. For an example of a site map please, see the following figure.

### **Wireframes** 

is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. By creating a wireframe, you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included. 

You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page. For an example of a wireframe please, see the following figure.

### **Organizing your page**

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in. We have here three main words: **Content**, **Prioritizing** and **Organizing**.

*  **Content** 

	Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate. As an example:
    + A masthead or logo
    + Links to navigate the site
    + Links to related content and other popular articles
    + Login or membership options

* **Prioritizing**

	If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand. By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to those items. Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages.

* **Organizing**

	Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler. By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style, users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content.


* **Visual hierarchy**

	Most web users do not read entire pages. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
    * Size
        > <font size="5">The way</font> to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. - Walt Disney
    * Color
        > <span style="color:orange">The way</span> to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. -Walt Disney
    * Style
        > ***The way*** to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. -Walt Disney

    
* **Grouping**

	Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.Here are some ways this can be achieved.


    
* **Similarity**

	We naturally observe similarities in design, and things that are similar are perceived to be more related than things that are dissimilar. Repetition of similar color, size, orientation, texture, font, or shape, suggests that matching elements have similar importance or meaning.

### **Designing Navigation**

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles..
* Concise
* Clear
* Selective
* Context
* Interactive
* Consistent
