# Seeing Your Remotes

Here we will talk about `git remote` command. This command is used to view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles. For example:
```javascript
git remote
```
Output
```javascript 
origin
```
And if you use `git remote -v`, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.For example:
```javascript
git remote -v
```
Output
```javascript 
origin  https://github.com/shadykh/reading-notes.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/shadykh/reading-notes.git (push)
```
