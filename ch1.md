
## **Structure:**
To bulid a web page you need to write the code that turn the wrods into web page, so here we will talk about the bones of the web page which is the **Structure**.

Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.

The **HTML** is the langunage used to build a web pages, فاث **HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language. The **HyperText** part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. **A markup language** allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.

So, now I think that we got enhoth talking so let us start coding.
``` 
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
        <p>Anything within the body of a web page is
        displayed in the main browser window.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
This code give you this output:
>
> <html>
> <head>
> <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
> </head>
> <body>
> <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
> <p>Anything within the body of a web page is
> displayed in the main browser window.</p>
> </body>
> </html>
