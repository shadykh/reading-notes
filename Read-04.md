# Programming with JavaScript
### Did you ever used the slideshow or forms in any webpage? How you interact with them? Did you access, modify, program or react to the content in some webpage?
<br>

### I think that you already did those things! This is done by Java Script, yes the language that used to :
- #### Access content.
- #### Modify content.
- #### Program rules.
- #### React to events.
<br>

### Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming.  
- ### What is a script and how do I create one?
    - ### **A script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

- ### How do computers fit in with the world around them?
    - ### Computers create models of the world using data, those models use objects to represent physical things.
- ### How do I write a script for a web page?
    - ### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

<br>

### In the js we have:
- ### **Expression**
    - ### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. As an example of expression:
        - var color = 'red';
- ### **Operators**
    - ### Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. We have those types of operators: 
    - ### Assignment operators
        - Assign a value to a variable

            color = 'beige';
    - ### Arithmetic operators
        - Perform basic math

            area = 3 * 2;
    - ### Comparison operators
        - Compare two values and return true or false

            buy = 3 > 5;
    - ### String operators
        - Combine two strings

           greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';

    - ### Logical operators
        - LOGICAL OPERATORS Combine expressions and return true or false
        
            buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

<br>

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
<br>

### How do we declar a function:
    ```
    function printtest() {
        document.write("test);
    }
    ```

<br>

### How we call a function:
    ```
    printtest();
    ```
