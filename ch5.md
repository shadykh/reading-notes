## **Extra Markup**

In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had
started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.

Here we will go farther with the HTML5 commands, and we will have some examples, so keep track us here to get know more info about HTML5.

- DOCTYPE
    - Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.
         ```
          <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html lang="en">
         <head>
             <meta charset="UTF-8">
             <title>Home</title>
         </head>
         ```

- Comments in html
    - If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
        ```
        <!-- comment goes here -->
        ```

- ID Attribute
    - Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore.
        ```
        <p>Water and air. So very commonplace are these
        substances, they hardly attract attention - and
        yet they vouchsafe our very existence.</p>
        <p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel
        a calming sense of security, as if visiting my
        ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
        </p>
        <p>Mystery of mysteries, water and air are right
        there before us in the sea.</p>
        ```
        The reslut is:<br>
            Water and air. So very commonplace are these
            substances, they hardly attract attention - and yet they vouchsafe our very existence.<br>
            <font size="4"> **Every time I view the sea I feel a calming sense of security, as if visiting my ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.<br>**</font> 
            Mystery of mysteries, water and air are right
            there before us in the sea.

- Class Attribute
    - If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
        ```
        <!-- comment goes here -->
        ```

- Meta
    - The `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and
    contains information about that web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive.
